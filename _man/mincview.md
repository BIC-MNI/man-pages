# MINCVIEW

mincview - view a MINC file
`mincview mincfile slicenumber`

## DESCRIPTION

`mincview` converts the image into PNM format and loads one or all of the slices 
into *display* from Imagemagick. This is a very primitive tool, mostly useful 
for debugging but at least being a very low level tool should always work.

Controls for display are simple, use the <space> key for the next image or the 
right mouse button on the image for a more detailed menu interface

The programs Display or register are more suited for typical use.
