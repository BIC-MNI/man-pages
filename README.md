This is collection of documentation files for various minc tools. It was
auto-converted from the legacy .man files to github-style markup format and
then manually corrected.

The pages are now stored in markup format and auto-magically appear online at 
http://bic-mni.github.io/man-pages/

Also, static man pages are generated using pandoc and uploaded to 
https://github.com/BIC-MNI/man-pages/releases
for use in minc-toolkit installation.

Installation:

To create static troff formated man pages, make sure that you have pandoc and 
cmake installed. Then 
Use cmake to configure and build man pages. 

Contributing:

Right now all man pages are supposed to be placed in _man directory. The first 
two lines should be '---' to convince github pages that this is a properly 
formatted markup document. These lines are stripped when troff formated man pages
are generated.
