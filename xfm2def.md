# XFM2DEF
xfm2def convert a MNI transform file to a deformation volume
xfm2def
options
input.xfm
def\_vol.mnc
DESCRIPTION
===========

`xfm2def` takes an input transform *input.xfm* that can consist of a series of concatenated transforms in a single xfm file and converts this into a single deformation volume that is output as *def\_vol.mnc*. Note that the output is not a tranform file itself, you can then make use of this volume in a MINC tranform by creating an .xfm file as such:

MNI Transform File Transform\_Type = Grid\_Transform; Displacement\_Volume = def\_vol.mnc;

The output resolution and sampling of the deformation grid must be specified or a default size will be used. (100x100x100 1mm steps centred around the origin).
