This is collection of documentation files for various minc tools. It was
auto-converted from the legacy .man files to github-style markup format and
then manually corrected.

The pages are now stored in markup format and auto-magically appear online at http://bic-mni.github.io/man-pages/

Also, static man pages are generated using pandoc and uploaded to https://github.com/BIC-MNI/man-pages/releases
for use in minc-toolkit installation.
